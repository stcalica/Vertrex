Website Map Overlay for TrekThePlanet website


Will be written using jQuery, Bootstrap, Google-maps API and hopefully Django Python! 


This website will track and log the travels and expenses of TechnoHippy and CyberPunk
Be able to click on a site we are at or going to visit to see information on the trip and 
a video diary listing from both of us. Along with highlight videoes. 

The site will allow people to donate to us and/or offer advice. 

Probably will add facebook functionality or sometype of commenting system to be able to talk to visitors.
